This R code creates a function to clean tweets for sentiment analysis. 
The clean tweet function removes the following:

Retweet entities. 
Removes "@username" labels.
Removes punctuation.
Removes numbers.
Removes html links.
Removes unnecessary spaces.
Removes emojis or special characters



The code also applies a number of different analytical functions and plots on the cleaned tweets. 
Such as sentiment scoring across four different lexicons, emotion scoring using the NRC dictionary, 
comparison word cloud, narrative timelines, emotional plot trajectory etc. 

Note this folder also contains sentiment scoring for all companies in the project. In addition, the code
sentiment scores all the president's tweets.
